##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####

##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> Hmm, once I knew what I was doing it was pretty smooth. The in-class explination was really helpful. Without it I'm not sure what I would've done. Probably around a 6? I'm not 100% sure I did everything right, such as re-doing the UI.  


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Not any that I can think of!
